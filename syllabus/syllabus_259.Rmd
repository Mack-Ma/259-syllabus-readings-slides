# Course Objectives

1. You'll learn this

2. And also that

3. Perhaps some of this too.

# Course Materials

- The course [Github page](https://github.com/PSYC-259-Data-Science) has links to project files, readings, and the syllabus
- We will work through examples and complete assignments through a course workspace on [RStudio Online](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/106138/projects). To sign up, follow this [link](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/106138/join?access_code=W90ZG4T1F5TjqEW7EloGQQcpp%2BKrTmufayP9G5Hj). You will need to create a free user account. We will go over how to access materials on the first day of class. 
- Readings from *R for Data Science* [@WickhamGrolemund2017] are available [online](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)
- Other course readings available on Github and are referenced below

# Course Policy

I will detail the policy for this course below. Basically, don't cheat and try to learn stuff. Don't be that guy.

## Grading Policy

- **20%** of your grade will be determined by a midterm during normal class hours.

- **20%** of your grade will be determined by a term paper that documents your appreciation of Foghat's "Slow Ride", the most important song ever written. "Slow Ride" is what Mozart wishes *Don Giovanni* could have been.

- **10%** of your grade will be determined by your attendance and participation in class. Generally, ask questions and answer them.

- **20%** of your grade will be determined by a 20-page term paper on when exactly "The Love Boat" jumped the proverbial shark. You will address whether this shark-jumping can be attributed to Ted McGinley, the introduction of Jill Whelan as "Vicki", or some other cause.

- **30%** of your grade will be determined by a final exam.

# Class Schedule

Students must read the following before Tuesday's class session.  Important: class readings are subject to change, contingent on mitigating circumstances and the progress we make as a class.  Students are encouraged to attend lectures and check the course website for updates.
